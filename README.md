# SudokuSolver
My custom project for special Topics

This project was done for demonstration purposes of C#.

It is a simple Sudoku-Solver/Generator. Feel free to use it or have a look at the code.

Disclaimer: The goal of this project was to demonstrate as much of the features as possible. Some things are unnecessary for the functionality (e.g. the whole Novem Tree)
